# 25 Days of Tech Tips

## 25 Days of Tech Tips
Let's start a new trend this year. I want to help give back to the amazing tech community by sharing tips and tricks. The goal is that each day at least one person learns something new from the content you share. 

## How to participate
Each day from 12/1 through 12/25, share one post on social media that is a tech tip, using the hashtag #25DAYSOFTECHTIPS 

I will be sharing mine daily on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/_chrisbenjamin)

## What counts?
You can share tips and tricks about anything in IT, it doesn't have to be web development specific, you can tweet about your subject matter or find something new and interesting to share with the community. 

## Example Topics
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Python
- Ruby
- PHP
- Next.js
- Remix 
- Vue
- Angular
- Networking
- Linux
- Windows
- Powershell

If you are sharing code, you should try and include a snippet, or a link to help your audience understand your tip or trick. A great website for sharing code snippets is [Ssnippet](https://www.ssnippet.app/)
