# A Day in the life of a IT Manager | Developer | System Administrator

## What is it like to work as an IT Manager | Developer | Systems Administrator? 
I thought I would take the time to describe a day in my life. This describes a single day as a snapshot. If you are considering a career in IT, development, or systems administration this article will provide some insight into a typical day. 

### About my job:
I work as the single IT person, sometimes referred to as one-man show, for a small company, I have been here almost 2 years in this role. I am the IT Manager, System Administrator, and Developer. I oversee the entire IT infrastructure of the business including servers, workstations, network, backup, and security. I also manage and develop our business software, website, and in-house software solutions. I manage my own budget and I plan my own projects and days on an annual basis. I also create and maintain business compliance policies relating to physical, administrative, and technical security. 

In this role, I wear many hat's and no two days are the same which is why I love my job so much. Some days I spend 6 hours coding on a new project I'm developing, other days I spend the day putting out small fires and working on projects.

This day was a typical Tuesday in my life. No other day will be the same as this one but I wouldn't change it for the world. I love that every day is new opportunities for growth and resolving business problems. The people I work with are fantastic and provide great solutions to problems along with responsive feedback for issues.
